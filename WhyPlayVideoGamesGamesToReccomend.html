  <h1>Games To Reccomend</h1>
  <p> There are a few excellent games i would reccomend to the people who is reading on this website. These games include  Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, the Xenoblade Chronicles series, terraria, and the persona series.</p>

<p>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet like its predecessor have a decent amout of replayabilty. The main reason behind this is there are many ways of playing the game. Some people choose to impose challenges on themselves, look for rare color alterations of pokemon via shiny hunting, or they like  to build competitively optimal teams to test against other players. This gives a lot of depth to pokemon Encouraging fans to keep playing the games from the series. Pokemon Scarlet and Violet can be played on the ninendo switch (create link to equipment page here).</p>

<p>Another Series of games that has a great deal of replayablility is the jrpg Xenoblade Chronicles. There are four games in the series which consists of Xenoblade Chronicles, Xenoblade Chronicles X, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3.  If you want to get into gaming and like anime this game is for you. Outside of having well written stories and sometimes having comedy relief moments it has very innovative  and unique combat in each game. The main base mechanic to charge up stronger moves called arts is to autoattack which takes a few seconds to finish a cycle. The combat of each game has their own neuonces and are complicated but is fun after mastering. The other really outstanding element of these games is the music of each game. Each music piece really does really well at setting a mood whether its sad, imposing or Joyful.</p>

<p>For the people who are interested in both combat and building in 2d terraria is a prime choice. It has many bosses and enemies to fight and a varity of gear to utilize to defeat said opponents. Outside of combat you can create insane structures with many different blocks and furnature to get npcs to move in and sell you items. To top it all off you can paint blocks and furnature to add more detail and shadows. This game has dedicated developers that keep adding content updates for free. Terraria is a widely avalible game on many <a href="WhyPlayVideoGamesGamingEquipment.html">platforms on phones, consoles, and pc</a>.</p>
